## 🆚 Comparison: Direct API vs Current Setup

### Option A: Current Setup (Recommended) ✅

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No API key needed
- ✅ Unlimited calls (0.5s updates = 120/min)
- ✅ Same data as CMC
- ✅ Official CMC logo
- ✅ Free forever
- ✅ No rate limits
- ✅ Already working

**Disadvantages:**
- Uses CoinGecko as intermediary (but same data)

### Option B: Direct CoinMarketCap API

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Direct from CMC servers
- ✅ Official API

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Requires API key
- ❌ Free tier: Only 333 calls/day (~1 every 4 minutes)
- ❌ Can't support 0.5s updates on free tier
- ❌ Basic tier: $29/month for more calls
- ❌ Same data as CoinGecko anyway
- ❌ More complex setup

**Cost Comparison:**
- Free tier: 333 calls/day = ~0.23 calls/min
- Your need: 120 calls/min (0.5s updates)
- Required tier: Professional ($99/month) or higher

---

## 💡 Why Current Setup is Better

- Both use same price sources

### 3. **No Limitations**
- Current: 120 updates/minute ✅
