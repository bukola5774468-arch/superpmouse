## 🎯 Tips

### Adjust Update Speed
Edit `script.js` line 5 to change speed:
```javascript
const REFRESH_INTERVAL = 500;   // Current: 0.5 seconds (super fast!)
const REFRESH_INTERVAL = 1000;  // Change to: 1 second
const REFRESH_INTERVAL = 2000;  // Change to: 2 seconds
```

### Use CoinMarketCap API Instead
See `API_SETUP.md` for instructions to switch from CryptoCompare to CoinMarketCap!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Must use localhost** - Don't open `index.html` directly by double-clicking
2. **Why?** - Browsers block API calls from `file://` URLs for security
3. **Solution** - Always use the BAT file or run a local server
4. **Internet Required** - Real-time data needs active internet connection

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Your dashboard is now running with **TRUE REAL-TIME** updates at **0.5-second intervals**!

Watch your crypto prices update **twice every second** with beautiful animations! 🚀
